\begin{abstract}

In the past decade, PlanetLab has become a popular testbed for testing
networked systems and evaluating their performance. However, due to differences
in the architecure of PlanetLab and the general Internet, results on PlanetLab
may not translate directly into performance on the general Internet.  To
provide a more accurate platform for this purpose, researchers have attempted
to improve PlanetLab's representativeness of the Internet. While answering the
question of, "What is representative of the general Internet?" is an on-going
topic in research, prior works have shown characteristics of these nodes to be
generally homogenous. 


While we don't know what to model PlanetLab after, increasing the heterogeneity
of PlanetLab interconnectivity would allow researchers to customize what type
of Internet they want to represent.  We therefore focus on adding heterogeneity
to PlanetLab to increase its ability to represent the Internet.  We do this by
exploiting the existing heterogeneity of university networks in the world. Our
work attempts to discover how PlanetLab nodes are similar and university nodes
with the most potential to provide diversity.

\section{Introduction}

PlanetLab is a network designed to connect large networks in academia. In this
way, a testbed is formed that is geographically distributed and collectively
managed. Although not it's original intention, many researchers take advantage
of this resource to conduct measures of the Internet.

However, due to the nature of it's design, qualities of PlanetLab sites are
found to be generally homogeneous. Sites are mostly connected to high speed
research networks located in the US and Europe. To allow PlanetLab to be a more
accurate Internet testbed, researchers have attempted to make the network more
representative of the Internet. A challenge to this is that we have an
incomplete view of what should be considered "representative". We therefore
focus on adding heterogeneity to PlanetLab to improve its likeness to the
Internet.

To function as a PlanetLab node, a site must meet certain resource and hardware
standards. For example, the site must be a server class machine and publicly
addressable by a static IP. These requirements allow PlanetLab to remain easily
managed and used but are mostly only met by University machines. There is
heterogeneity in university networks that is not represented in PlanetLab,
however. We attempt to pinpoint the universities that have the most potential
to increase PlanetLab diversity.  

Our goal is to first determine in what ways PlanetLab is homogenous. For this,
we look at number of hops, number of ASes and types of ASes traversed between
PlanetLab nodes. Next we compare potential PlanetLab sites organized by
geography, and determine in which location would nodes have a significant
impact on PlanetLab.

\section{Related Work} 

While measuring from well-connected hosts inside academic networks, Dischinger
et al.~\cite{dischinger:residential} characterized residential broadband
connections by sending packet trains to end-hosts. They included measurements
such as download and upload throughput, round-trip times and jitter, packet
loss rates, queue lengths, and queue drop policies. 

SatelliteLab~\cite{dischinger:satellitelab} 

Previous works have attempted measuring qualities of PlanetLab nodes. Banerjee
et all, found that 85\% of hosts are located within an interconnected network of
high speed research networks, which they refer to as the GREN. They also found
that 91\% of origin ASes are located in North America and 74\% North American
research ASes. PlanetLab nodes traversed 80 ASes, only 8\% of the 1123 existing
ASes. We are therefore motivated to measure potential heterogeneity of other
sites on the GREN.

Other works have also attempted to quantify PlanetLab’s heterogeneity. Banerjee
et all compared qualities of PlanetLab’s nodes on research and commercial
networks. Dischinger et all, looked at how adding hosts on edge networks could
affect PlanetLab. By increasing a subset of PlanetLab sites with 10\% worth of
edge nodes, the number of AS links tripled. This motivates their project,
SatelliteLab which integrates edge nodes to PlanetLab’s infrastructure. Under
SatelliteLab, the university connected network remains central to PlanetLab.
Our attempt to increase the diversity of university hosts would only add to the
heterogeneity this project achieves.

\section{Methodology}

In this section we describe the set up of our experiment. We discuss the
selection of potential new sites. 

\subsection{Selection of remote hosts}

First we had to create a list of potential PlanetLab sites. We considered any
university or college that is not currently hosting a PlanetLab node to be a
potential PlanetLab site. As such, we obtain a list of universities and
colleges by crawling two websites,
Wikipedia\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_universities_and_colleges_by_country}}
and Universities Worldwide\footnote{\url{http://univ.cc}}. For each school that
we found on these sites, we attempted to scrape that school's homepage. Since
many universities host their own website, we use this website as an estimate
for where the PlanetLab node would be placed. All measurements to the potential
PlanetLab site are made to the address of this website. From this list, we
identified 7010 potential sites.

Some schools may not be hosting their own page, but instead using a web hosting
company. In these cases, we could still ask the hosting company to install a
PlanetLab node if it were useful for researchers.

\subsection{Experiment}

After we had obtain a list of potential sites, we created a slice on PlanetLab
for measurement. We added all the PlanetLab nodes that were up and running when
we set up our experiment, resulting in 694 nodes being used for our slice. We
then conducted traceroute measurements on each PlanetLab node at a rate of one
per minute. Each node measured to all 7010 potential new sites and all 694
existing PlanetLab nodes, resulting in 7704 total sites being measured at each
node.

\section{Future work}

To continue our analysis of PlanetLab, we plan to explore more potential metrics
of heterogeneity. These include pathrate for end-to-end bandwidth measurements,
and bottleneck rates and fraction of IXP links. 

We also envision using our measurements to develop a reproducible methodology for
node selection. Selection would not be in terms of geographical location, but 
instead pinpoint sides individually. A key factor of this is determining the 
minimum number of nodes that  provide a significant impact.
